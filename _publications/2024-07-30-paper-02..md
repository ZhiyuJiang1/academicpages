Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial Z2 topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the Z2 topological phase becomes unstable due to Z2 nature. While several researchers report counterexamples of the instability, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we show that the Z2 topological phase is robust against the stacking if it has an additional chiral symmetry, in terms of the level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system. We demonstrate this by mapping a one-dimensional class DIII superconductor with Z2 topology to the corresponding non-Hermitian system in AIIâ€  with Z2 point-gap topology.
