I am a PhD student in the School of Engineering at [Hokkaido University](https://www.hokudai.ac.jp/), located in Sapporo, Japan. Originally from Shenyang, China, I specialize in theoretical condensed matter physics, focusing on topics such as open quantum systems, non-Hermitian systems, quantum walks, and topology. During my PhD studies, I have been particularly engaged in exploring the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems and simulating these effects using non-unitary quantum walks. I am also deeply interested in quantum computing. My doctoral research is supervised by Professor Hideaki Obuse. I can communicate in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and I look forward to engaging in diverse academic and cultural exchanges.
