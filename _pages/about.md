I am currently an Appointed Researcher in [Prof. Hiroshi Ueda (上田　宏)](https://researchmap.jp/hiroshi_ueda)'s group at the [Center for Quantum Information and Quantum Biology (QIQB)](https://qiqb.osaka-u.ac.jp/), [The University of Osaka](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/ja). As part of Prof. Ueda’s project, "[Quantum-classical fusion mediated by tensor network (テンソルネットワークの媒介する量子・古典融合)](https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/project/1111119/1111119_2024.html)", I investigate how tensor-network methods can deepen our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena and serve as powerful tools for quantum computation and quantum algorithms.

My broader research interests lie in theoretical condensed matter physics, particularly in open quantum systems, non-Hermitian physics, quantum walks, and topological phases. In previous work, I studied the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems and simulated these effects using non-unitary quantum walks, in collaboration with my doctoral advisor, [Prof. Hideaki Obuse (小布施　秀明)](https://researchmap.jp/hideaki.obuse).

I am now based in Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan and originally from Shenyang, China. I am fluent in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and I look forward to contributing to diverse academic and cultural exchanges.
