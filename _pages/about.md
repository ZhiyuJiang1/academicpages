I am an academic researcher in the Division of Applied Physics at the Graduate School of Engineering, [Hokkaido University](https://www.hokudai.ac.jp/), located in Sapporo, Japan. Originally from Shenyang, China, I specialize in theoretical condensed matter physics, focusing on topics such as open quantum systems, non-Hermitian physics, quantum walks, and topological phases. During my previous studies, I have been particularly engaged in exploring the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems and simulating these effects using non-unitary quantum walks. I am also deeply interested in topological quantum computing. My doctoral research is supervised by [Prof. Hideaki Obuse](https://researchmap.jp/hideaki.obuse). I can communicate in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and I look forward to engaging in diverse academic and cultural exchanges.
